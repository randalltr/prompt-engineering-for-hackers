## 4. No Warranty or Guarantee

There is no guarantee that any method described in this book will succeed, remain functional, or apply to current or future models. AI behavior is non-deterministic, and vendor updates may alter responses at any time.

## Final Note

*Black Hat AI* exists to inform, not incite.  
To uncover, not exploit.  
To make systems more resilient, not weaker.

Use this knowledge like a scalpel — not a weapon.  
And if you're not sure whether something is ethical, legal, or right?

**Don’t do it.**
